I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo who loves building cool things. I've been programming since I was 9 years old, and it's been quite a journeyâ€”from web development to AI/ML. Here are some of my notable public projects:
- [LiteNet](https://github.com/martin226/litenet), a C++ neural network framework built from scratch with 0 external dependencies.
- [Credibility](https://github.com/martin226/credibility), a research tool that uses LLMs and key metrics to assess the credibility of websites.
- [Sensai](https://github.com/martin226/sensai), a workout platform that uses computer vision to provide you with real-time suggestions and analytics.
- [Uptone](https://github.com/martin226/uptone), a browser extension that protects users from hate speech on Twitter/X via a CNN built for sentiment analysis.
- [My high school's website](https://github.com/stau-app-dev/main-website)
- ... and the [website for its mobile app](https://github.com/stau-app-dev/app-website)!

You can check out the rest of my projects [here](https://github.com/martin226?tab=repositories&q=&type=source).

Previously, I worked as an ML Research Intern at Sunnybrook Research Institute, building deep learning models to accelerate focused ultrasound treatment monitoring.
